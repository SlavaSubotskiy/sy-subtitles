I bow to all the seekers of truth. Today I want to tell you about the subtle system.
There are seven chakras within us. The kundalini resides in the sacrum bone.
When the kundalini rises it passes through these chakras. You feel the cool breeze on your hands.
This is the proof of self-realization. You become your own master.
Meditation is the way to grow deeper in your awareness.
